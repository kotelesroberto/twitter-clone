For using react flip move in Post.js we use "forwardRef"

BEFORE:
-------
const Post = 
  (
    {
      displayName,
      username,
      verified,
      timestamp,
      text,
      image,
      imageAlt,
      avatar,

      comments,
      numComments,
      retweets,
      likes,
      share,
    }
  )

AFTER (added ref):
------------------
const Post = forwardRef(
  (
    {
      displayName,
      username,
      verified,
      timestamp,
      text,
      image,
      imageAlt,
      avatar,

      comments,
      numComments,
      retweets,
      likes,
      share,
    },
    ref
  )


  In Feed.js (where Post.js is used) w will animate the post items.
